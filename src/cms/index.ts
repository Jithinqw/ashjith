This is followed by the tying of the `Minnu` with a small gold pendant shaped as a stylized heart with a cross symbol on it (Minnu) by the Groom around the neck of the Bride, and the adornment of the bridal attire (Manthrakodi). The Manthrakodi is placed on the head of the bride. This is the moment when the Bride becomes a member of the husband's family. To symbolize this event, a women from the family of the Bridegroom takes the place of the matron/maid of the honor as a gesture of welcome. The service concludes with an exhortation to the bride and groom, and a final benediction byt h e Chief celebrant."
